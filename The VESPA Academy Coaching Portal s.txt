The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal supports students preparing for GCSE resits by offering targeted, intensive interventions before the November and May exams. Using the VESPA Questionnaire, we identify key non-cognitive study behaviours that signal exam risk in Year 11 and Post 16 resit students. Those identified receive personalized coaching with tailored study plans and revision strategies. The portal also assesses socio-emotional factors such as Vision and Attitude, which reflect future-mindedness, academic buoyancy, and a growth mindset—areas often lower in students lacking the cultural capital of more economically advantaged students. Our bespoke student reports promote reflection and dialogue, enabling staff to address these issues early, helping to develop self-confidence and reduce exam stress. This balanced approach strengthens both academic skills and emotional resilience, while our framework ensures continuous support from school through to Post 16 providers..

The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal is an interactive, research-driven platform designed to enhance non-cognitive study behaviours in post-16 students. The programme operates on multiple levels, engaging pupils, practitioners, and settings through a series of structured activities and comprehensive support measures.
For Pupils:  VESPA Questionnaire: Students begin by completing an assessment that measures five key non-cognitive study behaviours: Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude.
Personalised Coaching Report: Based on the assessment, each student receives a tailored report that includes a score out of 10 for each element, detailed feedback, reflective goal-setting sections, and targeted coaching questions to guide subsequent discussions with tutors.VESPA Activities: Students are offered two recommended activities per element, designed to address areas of weakness and promote the development of effective study habits.
For Practitioners and Settings:  Teacher Dashboard: Educators access a dedicated dashboard where they can view individual and cohort-wide results, adjust activities based on student progress, and access resources such as interactive slide decks and activity PDFs.Targeted Interventions: For students identified as at risk of failing, the system recommends additional study strategies and intensive coaching sessions, ensuring prompt and effective support.
Support and Training:  Initial Training: Teachers and tutors participate in comprehensive training sessions that cover report interpretation, effective use of the dashboard, and implementation of targeted interventions. These sessions are delivered both in person and online, incorporating hands-on workshops and interactive demonstrations.Ongoing Support: The programme provides continuous support through regular webinars, a dedicated help desk, and an online community where educators can share best practices and troubleshoot challenges together.
Example Implementation Timeline:  The programme is initially launched as a 6–12 month pilot or efficacy trial, allowing for evaluation and iterative improvements. Following positive evaluation outcomes, a multi-year scale-up is planned to ensure sustained, measurable improvements in student study behaviours and academic attainment.Overall, the VESPA Academy Coaching Portal offers a comprehensive, data-driven approach that equips students with both the academic skills and emotional resilience needed for success, while providing educators with the tools and support necessary to deliver high-quality, tailored interventions.

The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal is purpose-built to break the cycle between socio-economic disadvantage and academic underachievement. Extensive research highlights that non-cognitive skills—such as effort, motivation, and study organisation—are critical predictors of success, yet many disadvantaged students lack the structured support needed to develop these skills. Our platform delivers targeted, evidence-based interventions that directly improve study habits while empowering tutors with structured coaching tools. By leveraging the validated VESPA Questionnaire, the portal provides personalised coaching reports and tailored activities that help students build independent study skills essential for further education and employment. This approach not only enhances immediate academic performance but also fosters long-term self-regulation and resilience. In addressing the study behaviour gap, our programme directly contributes to the EEF’s mission of reducing educational disparities and ensuring that every student, regardless of family income, has the opportunity to succeed academically. Furthermore, the portal integrates continuous progress monitoring and real-time feedback, enabling educators to dynamically adjust strategies. Its scalable design supports widespread adoption across diverse educational settings and cultivates a community of practice that shares and refines best teaching approaches, ensuring sustained support for students facing socio-economic challenges.

Evidence Basis 
Our programme builds on a strong evidence base that underscores the critical role of self-regulated learning and non-cognitive skills in academic success (Zimmerman, 2002), alongside research demonstrating that academic coaching can significantly improve student retention and performance (Bettinger & Baker, 2014). Digital feedback systems have also been shown to enhance learner engagement and outcomes (EEF, 2021), reinforcing the potential impact of our approach.
The VESPA Academy Coaching Portal contributes to this evidence base by using the validated VESPA Questionnaire to assess key study behaviours, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement. This assessment forms the cornerstone of our theory of change, which emphasizes student self-awareness as the first step towards targeted intervention. Personalized coaching reports and bespoke activities then guide students to enhance their motivation, organisation, and effort. Structured, mentor-led support ensures that interventions are effectively implemented, driving improved study habits that translate into better exam performance.
By addressing these non-cognitive factors, our programme not only aligns with sector interests in evidence-based, digital interventions but also bridges the gap between academic research and classroom practice, ultimately fostering sustainable academic growth and resilience across diverse learner populations.

Reach
Since launching in 2017, our programme has reached over 600 schools globally. Approximately 500 are in England, with expanding international reach across UAE, Australia, Malawi, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, South Africa and Portugal, demonstrating the programme's universal appeal. This extensive engagement demonstrates our ability to scale and adapt our evidence-based approach across diverse educational settings. Our collaborative work with local education authorities and individual schools has refined our model to better meet the needs of teachers and students. The broad uptake in England highlights the value and effectiveness of our interventions in supporting academic and socio-emotional development.

Feedback and research links
VESPA research demonstrates significant effectiveness across diverse educational settings. The model's core components (Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude) provide a structured framework for non-cognitive skill development that complements academic instruction.
Central South Consortium in Wales implemented VESPA across multiple schools, resulting in a 7.5% increase in A*-A Level grades. This improvement was directly attributed to VESPA's bespoke psychometric assessments and targeted intervention activities (Central South Consortium, 2021).
The University of Pretoria utilized VESPA to tailor student support programs, achieving a 4.45/5 student satisfaction score and improved retention rates.

Summary 
The VESPA model transforms how educational stakeholders approach student development by focusing on five key non-cognitive domains: Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, and Attitude. This framework creates systematic behaviour change across multiple levels:
For students, the VESPA framework provides explicit awareness of their learning behaviors and metacognitive processes. This self-knowledge empowers them to take greater ownership of their educational journey, moving from passive recipients to active participants who understand how specific behaviors impact outcomes. Students develop self-regulation skills and a growth mindset that extends beyond academic contexts. Our psychometric assessment helps students identify strengths and areas for development, creating personalised improvement pathways that foster intrinsic motivation and metacognitive awareness.
For teaching staff, VESPA shifts attention away from fixed notions of 'ability' towards learnable study behaviours. Teachers gain a structured lens to assess students' behaviors and a shared language that catalyses changes in thinking. This develops school culture away from micromanagement towards frameworked independence and metacognitive approaches. The model provides teachers with concrete intervention strategies aligned to specific VESPA domains, enabling more precise and effective support for struggling students.
Comprehensive training on interpreting psychometric reports equips staff with evidence-based strategies tailored to each student's profile. The platform's data-driven insights enable teachers to transform routine mentoring into targeted coaching sessions addressing specific VESPA domains. The reports provide immediate insights and actionable solutions, enhancing teacher effectiveness while driving a cultural shift towards reflective practice and collaborative problem-solving.
Educational settings benefit from the ability to monitor metacognitive development..  This visibility supports informed decision-making, facilitating early interventions where needed and allowing for systematic approaches to non-cognitive skill development throughout the school.
Parents receive clearer communication about their child's development beyond grades. This structured feedback enhances home-school partnerships and creates consistency between environments, amplifying intervention impact and engaging families as active partners in supporting non-cognitive skill development.
